Training Repository
===================
The [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://sanger.ac.uk/) software team are using this repository to train our
developers on how to effectively use [GitHub](http://github.com/) and [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/),
via our custom scripts, to work with the branching model we use.

There is absolutely no useful code here!
