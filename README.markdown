Training Repository
===================
The [Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute](http://sanger.ac.uk/) software team are using this repository to train our
developers on how to effectively use [GitHub](http://github.com/) and [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com/),
via our custom scripts, to work with the branching model we use.

There is absolutely no useful code here!

1. Fork the repository
2. git clone your fork
3. git sanger init
4. git sanger follow
5. do stuff
